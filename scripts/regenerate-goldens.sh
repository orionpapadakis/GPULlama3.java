# recover.bailout=False is mandatory: with the default TRUE a failed kernel silently falls back to
# sequential Java and would produce a wrong golden instead of an error (capability C4).
# llama.deviceSample=false keeps the full logits row crossing to the host, which is what is hashed.
# The backend priorities pin CUDA: a multi-backend SDK defaults to OpenCL, and a golden recorded on
# one backend is not the tuple the other one runs. They are no-ops on an OpenCL-only SDK.
