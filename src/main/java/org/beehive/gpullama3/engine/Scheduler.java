/**
 * Admission and slot assignment for the engine: who runs next, and against which blocks.
 *
 * <p><b>Strict FCFS, and strictly means strictly</b>. Admission looks at the head of the queue and
 * stops there. It never scans past a request it cannot yet fit to find a smaller one it can — that
 * is what defers a large request indefinitely under sustained load. The cost is head-of-line
 * blocking, which is visible and measurable; the alternative is starvation, which is neither.
 *
 * <p><b>Whole-budget reservation</b>. An admitted request takes the blocks its declared budget
 * needs, once, and holds them until it reaches a terminal state. There is no incremental growth and
 * no revisiting, so a request cannot be starved after admission — and any exhaustion that does
 * happen afterwards is an invariant violation rather than a capacity event.
 *
 * <p><b>Fixed B</b>. The slot count is set at construction; each step may have 0…B running and
 * empty slots are inactive, not errors. Changing B means constructing again.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safety follows the contract: {@link #submit} and {@link #cancel} are safe from any
 * thread; {@link #admit} runs inside the single caller's {@code step()}.
