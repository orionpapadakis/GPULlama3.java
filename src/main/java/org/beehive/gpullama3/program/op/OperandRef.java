/**
 * A reference to a tensor an operation reads or writes, by name rather than by handle.
 *
 * <p>An operation is a description, so it cannot hold a buffer, a device address or a {@code
 * TensorDescriptor} bound to one. It names what it needs and leaves resolution to the program layer
 * which is also where the reference acquires a binding class: a {@link Weight} resolves to a
 * program-fixed device binding, and an {@link Activation} to a workspace or staging array that is
 * equally program-fixed but written per invocation.
 *
 * <p>The split is exactly that — weights are addressed by {@link TensorRole}, which the runtime
 * already owns as a closed set, while activations are addressed only by name because no role
 * vocabulary describes them and inventing one would be a second dispatch key.
 *
 * <p>Sealed: a third kind of operand would be a change to how programs bind, not a convenience.
