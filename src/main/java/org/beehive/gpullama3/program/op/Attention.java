/**
 * Scaled dot-product attention of one query set against a set of keys and values.
 *
 * <p><b>No cache is named here, and that is the point.</b> The keys and values are operands like
 * any other. Where they come from — a retained per-sequence cache addressed through a block table,
 * or an encoder's freshly computed projections — is the program's business, not the operation's.
 * Rule 14 forbids core abstractions from <i>requiring</i> a KV cache, and an attention operation
 * that named one would close the door on encoder-only and embedding models before they were asked
 * for.
 *
 * <p>Grouped query attention is expressed by {@code keyValueHeads &lt; heads}, not by a second
 * operation; multi-head attention is the case where they are equal.
 *
 * <p><b>Sliding-window attention is a parameter, not a second operation.</b> The mathematics is
 * identical; only the lower bound of the score loop moves, and a full-attention family passes the
 * empty window and executes what it always executed.
 *
 * @param query the query projection
 * @param keys the keys attended over
 * @param values the values attended over
 * @param output the attention result
 * @param heads the number of query heads
 * @param keyValueHeads the number of key/value heads; equal to {@code heads} for MHA, fewer for GQA
 * @param headDimension the size of one head
 * @param scale the value applied to the scores, in the direction {@code scoreScaling} names. Under
 *     {@link ScoreScaling#DIVIDE}, the default, it is the <b>divisor</b> — conventionally {@code
 *     sqrt(headDimension)}, which is what every Llama-shaped caller passes and what the validators
 *     check
 * @param scoreScaling whether {@code scale} divides the scores or multiplies them. Granite's µP
 *     multiplier <i>replaces</i> the conventional division rather than following it, and expressing
 *     it as a division by its reciprocal rounds — the mode is why {@code AttentionShape} already
 *     carries one on the host side
 * @param dataType the representation the keys and values are stored in; the FP16 key/value cache is
 *     this parameter, not a separate operation
