/**
 * Root-mean-square normalization with a learned per-channel scale.
 *
 * <p>{@code output = input / rms(input) * weight}, where the epsilon guards the reciprocal square
 * root. Epsilon comes from the model's configuration and is therefore part of the description, not
 * something supplied per invocation.
 *
 * <p><b>The weight is optional, and its absence is stated rather than faked.</b> Gemma4 normalizes
 * its values with no learned scale at all. An all-ones weight would be the obvious substitute and
 * is refused: besides being untrue, it adds one multiplication per element that the model does not
 * perform.
 *
 * <p>Families differ in where they apply it and in one detail this description deliberately does
 * not model: some add one to the stored weight before scaling. That is a property of how a family
 * stores its weights, and it belongs to the architecture that assembles the program or to the
 * loader, not to the meaning of "normalize".
 *
 * <h2>Groups</h2>
 *
 * <p>Some families normalize <b>per head</b> rather than over the whole operand: Qwen3 applies its
 * query and key norms once per head, at that head's offset and for that head's length. A group
 * count and a group length say so in one component. The default — one group over everything — is
 * what every other family does, so nothing else changes shape.
 *
 * @param input the activations to normalize
 * @param weight the learned scale, or empty for the unweighted form
 * @param output where the normalized activations are written; may be {@code input}
 * @param epsilon the variance epsilon from the model configuration
 * @param dataType the representation the normalization executes at
 * @param groups how many independent groups are normalized; 1 for the whole operand
 * @param groupLength how many elements one group covers, or 0 when {@code groups} is 1 and the
 *     length is the operand's own
