 * How a rotary embedding pairs the components it rotates.
 *
 * <p>The rotation is the same arithmetic in both cases — a complex multiply by a precomputed
 * frequency — and the layouts differ only in <b>which two components form a pair</b>. That is a
 * property of how a family stores its projections, which makes it configuration rather than a
 * second operation ({@code target-architecture.md}: operations are "parameterized by configuration,
 * not hard-coded per architecture").
 *
 * <p>Getting it wrong is silent: both layouts read valid floats and produce plausible activations,
 * and the model simply answers slightly wrong. That is the same failure shape as the hardcoded RoPE
 * bases this project already paid for, which is why the layout is named rather than implied by
 * which kernel happened to be called.
