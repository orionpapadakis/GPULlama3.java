/**
 * Stochastic selection of the next token from the logits.
 *
 * <p><b>Temperature, top-p and the seed are not here.</b> They change per request and are delivered
 * as invocation values — written into a persistent control array before the invocation, never by
 * rebinding one. Carrying them in the description would put them in the program signature, and
 * therefore in the compiled-program cache key, which would compile a separate program for every
 * temperature a caller ever asks for.
 *
 * <p>That is the whole difference from {@link ArgMax}: same operands, parameters supplied later.
 * Which of the two a program contains is an execution-policy choice resolved once at session
 * creation, not a per-token branch.
 *
 * @param logits the scores to sample from
 * @param output where the chosen identifier is written
 * @param dataType the representation the logits are held in
