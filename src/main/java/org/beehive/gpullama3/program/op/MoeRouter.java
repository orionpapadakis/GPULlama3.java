/**
 * Choosing which experts a token is routed to, and with what weight.
 *
 * <p>One operation rather than four steps. A router projection, a normalization over the scores and
 * a top-k selection are one <b>semantic result</b> — "these experts, these weights" — and naming
 * them separately would pin the sequence as program structure and forbid a backend from doing them
 * in one kernel.
 *
 * <h2>What it produces</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two parallel sequences of length {@code topK}: the selected expert identifiers and their
 * routing weights. The full score vector over every expert is the operation's <b>working
 * buffer</b>, declared because every device array is, but not a program-visible result: nothing
 * downstream reads it, and publishing scratch would make it part of the contract.
 *
 * <h2>Semantics that are not free to vary</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each of these is visible in the floating-point result, because the selection order is the
 * accumulation order ({@link WeightedAccumulate}):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>normalization runs over <b>all</b> experts and <b>precedes</b> selection, and the selected
 *       weights are those probabilities <b>unrescaled</b>;
 *   <li>ties select the <b>lowest expert index</b>;
 *   <li>the selected experts come out in <b>descending weight order</b>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A backend may fuse projection, normalization and selection into one kernel. It may not change
 * any of the three.
 *
 * <h2>Not the sampler's selection</h2>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not {@link ArgMax} or {@link Sample}. Those take logits and produce one token
 * identifier; this takes activations, produces {@code k} identifiers <b>and</b> {@code k} weights,
 * and normalizes first. Sharing a type would mean sharing semantics that differ in every one of
 * those respects.
 *
 * @param input the activations the router scores, normally a feed-forward norm output
 * @param routerWeight the router's projection weight
 * @param scores working buffer for the per-expert scores, {@code numberOfExperts} long
 * @param selectedIds where the chosen expert identifiers are written, {@code topK} long
 * @param selectedWeights where their routing weights are written, {@code topK} long
 * @param numberOfExperts how many experts the router scores
 * @param topK how many are selected
 * @param normalization how the scores are turned into weights
 * @param dataType the representation the routing executes at
