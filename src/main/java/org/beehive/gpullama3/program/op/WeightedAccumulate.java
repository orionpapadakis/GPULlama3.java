/**
 * Accumulating a branch result into the residual stream with a scalar weight.
 *
 * <p>Distinct from {@link ResidualAdd}, which adds a branch back unweighted, and from {@link Scale}
 * followed by an add, which would scale a buffer the caller may still need. In a mixture of experts
 * this <b>is</b> the residual connection: there is no separate add afterwards, so the order in
 * which these run is the order the floating-point sum is formed.
 *
 * <p>The weight is read from an element of a buffer rather than carried as a parameter, because it
 * is computed per token — a routing probability, or a gate score — and a parameter would make it
 * part of the program's identity.
 *
 * @param stream the residual stream, accumulated into in place
 * @param branch the branch result being added
 * @param weightSource the buffer holding the scalar weight
 * @param weightIndex which element of it to read
 * @param gate what to apply to the weight before using it
 * @param length how many elements to accumulate
 * @param dataType the representation the accumulation executes at
