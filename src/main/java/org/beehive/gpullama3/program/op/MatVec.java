/**
 * A weight matrix times one activation vector.
 *
 * <p>The decode path's workhorse: every projection in a single-token step is one of these. It is
 * kept distinct from {@link MatMul} because the two are genuinely different work on a device — a
 * matrix-vector product is bandwidth-bound and a matrix-matrix product is not, and they reach
 * different kernels — not because the shapes could not be unified on paper.
 *
 * <p><b>Where dequantization went.</b> Nowhere: it stays inside whichever implementation needs it.
 * A backend whose weight representation is encoded decodes blocks in its own inner loop, as the CPU
 * does for the K-quants; a backend that cannot execute a representation was given a materialized
 * fallback at load, as the GPU is given {@code Q8_0}. There is no decode operation to place before
 * this one.
 *
 * @param weight the weight matrix
 * @param input the activation vector
 * @param output the resulting vector
 * @param rows rows of the weight matrix, and the length of {@code output}
 * @param columns columns of the weight matrix, and the length of {@code input}
 * @param dataType the representation the weight matrix was materialized in
