/**
 * Adding a learned bias vector to a projection.
 *
 * <p>Arithmetically the same elementwise addition as {@link ResidualAdd}, and a separate operation
 * anyway, because the two are different work in every way that matters to a program: this one's
 * right-hand side is a <b>model weight</b> addressed by role, not an activation coming back from a
 * branch, and it sits immediately after a projection rather than at the end of a block. A program
 * that called both "add" would need the operand kinds inspected to tell a bias from a residual
 * connection.
 *
 * <p>Qwen2 and Qwen2-MoE are why it exists: they carry {@code q_bias}, {@code k_bias} and {@code
 * v_bias} where Llama carries none. Added under the rule {@link OperationKind} states — the work
 * genuinely differs, rather than a family arranging the same work differently.
 *
 * @param input the projection the bias is added to
 * @param bias the learned bias vector
 * @param output the result; may be {@code input}
 * @param dataType the representation the addition executes at
