/**
 * Separating a fused gate/up feed-forward projection into its two halves.
 *
 * <p>Phi3 projects the gate and the up branches with <b>one</b> matrix of width {@code 2 ×
 * hiddenDim} and reads the halves out of the single result. The projection is one {@code MatVec} —
 * one matrix, one multiply — and this is what happens to its output before {@link SwiGLU} combines
 * the two.
 *
 * <p>The twin of {@link SplitFusedQkv}, added by the same decision and for the same reason: it
 * transforms a <b>per-invocation activation, after the projection has run</b>, on every token,
 * where materialization is a loading and storage-representation concern fixed once. A backend may
 * fuse the projection, this split and the {@code SwiGLU} into one kernel — Phi3's GPU path already
 * does, as {@code splitGateUpAndSiLU} — and still be doing exactly what it should. What is not
 * optional is that the program says the split happens.
 *
 * @param fused the projection result holding the gate and up halves end to end
 * @param gate where the gate half is written
 * @param up where the up half is written
 * @param width elements in each half; the projection produces {@code 2 × width}
 * @param dataType the representation the copy executes at
