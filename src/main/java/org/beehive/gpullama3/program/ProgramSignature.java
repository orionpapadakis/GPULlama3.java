/**
 * What a program is, as a value — and therefore what makes two compiled programs the same one.
 *
 * <p>It is the compiled-program cache key's largest component, which turns value-comparability from
 * a style preference into a correctness requirement: an accidental identity comparison is a silent
 * cache miss that recompiles the same program, or worse a claimed match that is not one. Three
 * rules make it real, all enforced at construction:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>No Java arrays</b>, at any depth. Arrays compare by identity.
 *   <li><b>Defensive copies</b> of every collection, so a signature handed a caller's mutable list
 *       does not change when that list does.
 *   <li><b>Canonical ordering</b>, validated here — bindings by index, phases in {@link PhaseId}
 *       order, component indices ascending within a phase. Two semantically identical signatures
 *       cannot differ because one collection was built in a different iteration order.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately absent</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>No device handles, no TornadoVM types, no format types.</b> A signature that held handles
 * could not be compared, logged, or used as a key (Rule 3).
 *
 * @param architecture the architecture identity. Held as a {@link ArchitectureId}: it was a bare
 *     {@code String} only because the type lived in {@code model.provider}, which Rule 9 does not
 *     let {@code program.**} reach. Moving it to {@code runtime.model} removed the reason, and with
 *     it the chance of two layers disagreeing about how an architecture is spelled
 * @param policy the execution policy the program was described under, as a stable descriptor; a
 *     value type will replace this
 * @param capacity what the device arrays were sized from
 * @param components the program's components, in order
 * @param phases one selection per phase, in {@link PhaseId} order
 * @param bindings the binding surface, in index order
