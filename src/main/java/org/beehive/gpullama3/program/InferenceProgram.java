 * <p>A backend lowers it. That lowering is <b>many-to-many and backend-owned</b>: one operation may
 * become several tasks, several operations may fuse into one, and one operation may become
 * different task sets depending on compile options or device capability. The TornadoVM builders
 * already do all three, which is why lowering is written per backend rather than derived from rules
