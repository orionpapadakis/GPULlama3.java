/**
 * The sink behind the CLI's metrics report — {@link RunMetrics} seen through the Rule 17 seam.
 *
 * <p>{@code RunMetrics} predates the seam: it is a static holder that producers call directly and
 * the CLI prints at the end of a run. This sink does not replace it. It gives the same collector a
 * second, seam-shaped way in, so that a producer which knows only {@link MetricsSink} — a backend,
 * for instance — reaches the same report as a producer that calls {@code RunMetrics} directly.
 * <b>What the CLI prints is unchanged</b>: set-up and phase keys land in the very fields the
 * renderers already read.
 *
 * <p>Device-side keys have no field on {@link RunMetricsSnapshot} and are <b>not</b> printed. They
 * accumulate here, by the key's own {@link MetricKey#aggregation()} rule, and are readable through
 * {@link #deviceMetrics()} — programmatically available without changing a line of CLI output.
 *
 * <p>Installed only when asked for: see {@link #installedOrDisabled()}. Collecting device metrics
 * means enabling the backend's profiler, which is paid per execution, so the default stays {@link
 * MetricsSink#disabled()}.
