/**
 * The sink for a caller that wants the numbers rather than a printout: it accumulates what it is
 * given and hands back a {@link MetricsReport}.
 *
 * <p>Each key combines by its own {@link MetricKey#aggregation()} — summing per-execution
 * measurements, keeping the last reading of a level. Doing that here rather than in the producer is
 * the point of the seam: the producer reports what it measured and does not have to know how a
 * run's total is formed.
 *
 * <p>Safe to hand to a backend, which reports from its execution threads.
