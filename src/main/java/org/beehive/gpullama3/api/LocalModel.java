/**
 * A loaded model: weights, configuration and whatever the backend compiled for them.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread-safe.</b> Immutable after load; any number of threads may read it and open sessions
 * from it (through a capability such as {@link TextGenerationModel}).
 *
 * <p><b>Generation is not assumed.</b> A model that only produces embeddings is a {@code
 * LocalModel} and nothing more; generation lives on {@link TextGenerationModel}, which is where
 * {@code newSession()} is declared. There is no {@code forward(.)}, no sampler and no plan accessor
 * here: execution belongs below the model, generation policy above it.
 *
 * <h2>Closing</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #close()} <b>throws {@link IllegalStateException} while sessions from this model are
 * still open</b>, naming them, and never force-closes them — closing another thread's session
 * mid-generation is a worse failure than an exception. A failed close has no effect: the model
 * stays open and usable, so the caller can close the sessions and try again. A successful close is
 * idempotent, and no session may be opened afterwards.
 *
 * <p>The natural spelling is nested try-with-resources, model outer and session inner.
