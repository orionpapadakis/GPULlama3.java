/**
 * Turns the loop's raw token ids into the façade's ordered event stream [A5].
 *
 * <h2>Why a token is held back</h2>
 *
 * <p>The generation loop's internal callback fires <b>before</b> its stop check, so it sees the
 * terminal stop token. That is an accident of ordering rather than a contract, and publishing it
 * would put control-token ids in the public stream forever. So one token is held: when the next
 * arrives, the held one is emitted; at the end, a held terminal stop token is dropped and anything
 * else is emitted.
 *
 * <p>The cost is one token of latency, and it buys two guarantees a consumer can rely on: the
 * stream contains no control tokens, and <b>the number of events equals {@link
 * GenerationResult#generatedTokens()}</b>.
 *
 * <p>A stop token that appears mid-stream — possible only with the ignore-end-of-sequence debug
 * flag, which makes the loop continue past one — is emitted, because it is then genuinely part of
 * the output and is counted as such.
 *
 * <h2>Incremental decoding</h2>
 *
 * <p>A token can carry part of a multi-byte character, and decoding it alone yields a replacement
 * character rather than text. Such a token is held in a pending list and its event carries empty
 * text; when the bytes complete, the text is attached to the event that completes them.
 * Concatenating every non-empty text therefore equals the full response.
