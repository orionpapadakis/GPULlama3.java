 * <h2>Backend and device selection</h2>
 *
 * <p>When neither is set the existing mechanism still decides, so nothing that works today stops
 * working: {@code -Duse.tornadovm=true}, which is what the {@code llama-tornado} launcher's {@code
 * --gpu} sets.
 *
 * <p><b>What a selector can constrain today is narrower than what it can express.</b> The backend
 * is honoured; a device index, a name fragment or a capability requirement is <b>not</b> — nothing
 * in the tree yet places a plan on a chosen device, and per-task placement is a TornadoVM
 * capability this project has not taken up. Asking for one of those <b>throws</b> rather than being
 * ignored, because a selection that is silently dropped is the failure {@code --cuda} without
 * {@code --gpu} used to be: it runs, it is wrong, and nothing says so.
