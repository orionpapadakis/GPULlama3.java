/**
 * A session on the lowered path: it owns logical values and <b>borrows</b> everything physical.
 *
 * <p><b>It constructs no {@code State} of its own.</b> That is the whole point of the slice: a
 * session that kept one would allocate its own activation, projection, attention and temporary
 * arrays — the duplication the shared workspace exists to remove — even while sharing the compiled
 * program. So the execution state it hands out is the <b>domain's workspace</b>, and what it owns
 * is a {@link SessionLogicalState} and a lease.
 *
 * <p>Sharing the workspace is safe because invocation is serialized behind the compiled program's
 * boundary, which holds the domain's lock across staging, execution and copy-out, and releases it
 * before any caller code runs.
 *
 * <p><b>One field of the borrowed workspace is session-logical and must never be read here:</b>
 * {@code latestToken}. The generation loop writes it per token, and on the single-token path never
 * reads it back — its driver is a local. This runtime keeps its own copy so that nothing depends on
 * the shared one, and a test poisons the workspace's value between two sessions' turns to prove the
 * independence rather than assert it.
