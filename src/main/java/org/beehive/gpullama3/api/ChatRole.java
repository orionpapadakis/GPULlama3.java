 * record Role(String name)} carrying six values, three of which are fill-in-the-middle roles;
 * publishing it would put FIM in the public API as a side effect of a chat surface, and would make
 * every family's role vocabulary a compatibility surface.
 *
 * <p>Closed, unlike {@code BackendId} and {@code DeviceCapability}, which are open values because a
 * backend or a capability can arrive from outside this project. A fifth conversational role is a
 * decision, not an extension point.
