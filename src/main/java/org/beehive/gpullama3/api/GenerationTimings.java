 * same numbers, returned rather than printed, so a program can act on them.
 *
 * <p>Rates are derived from the counts and durations rather than stored, so they cannot disagree
 * with them. A phase that took no measurable time reports a rate of zero rather than infinity — a
 * run too short to time is not a run of infinite speed.
