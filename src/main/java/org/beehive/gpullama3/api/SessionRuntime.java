/**
 * How one session gets the state and the plan it executes with.
 *
 * <p>Two implementations, and the difference between them is an ownership difference rather than a
 * mode flag: the legacy runtime **owns** a per-session {@code State} and its plan, while the
 * lowered runtime owns only session-logical values and **borrows** a binding domain's workspace and
 * its shared compiled program.
 *
 * <p>A typed seam on purpose. The alternative — a nullable {@code State} and {@code if (lowered)}
 * scattered through {@code DelegatingSession} — would put the ownership rules in the reader's head
 * instead of in the types, and lifecycle is exactly where that goes wrong: what {@code close()}
 * releases differs between the two, and getting it wrong frees device memory another session is
 * still using.
