/**
 * The head geometry one attention call works over.
 *
 * <p>Nine numbers rather than "head size", because the families genuinely disagree about what a
 * head size is. Llama has one: queries, keys and values are all {@code dim / heads}. Qwen3 has
 * three — {@code attention.key_length}, {@code attention.value_length} and the stride its query
 * buffer is laid out with — and they need not be equal to each other or to {@code dim / heads}.
 * Collapsing them would work on Llama and quietly mis-address Qwen3.
 *
 * <p>Bundled into a value so the call site reads as geometry rather than as nine loose ints, and so
 * a family's shape can be built once and asserted against.
 *
 * @param heads number of query heads
 * @param kvMul query heads per key/value head; 1 for multi-head, more for grouped query
 * @param queryHeadStride distance between one head's queries and the next in the query buffer
 * @param keyHeadStride distance between one key/value head and the next inside a cached row
 * @param keyDotLength how many components of a key a score is the dot product over
 * @param valueHeadDim width of one head's value, and the stride of the output buffer
 * @param kvDim width of one cached row: all key/value heads together
 * @param contextLength stride between heads in the score buffer
 * @param scoreScaling whether a raw score is divided or multiplied by {@link #scoreScale}
 * @param scoreScale the divisor or the multiplier, depending on {@link #scoreScaling}
 * @param window how many positions back a query may attend, or 0 for full causal attention — the
 *     sliding-window layers Gemma4 alternates with full ones
