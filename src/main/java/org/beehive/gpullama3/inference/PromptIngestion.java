/**
 * Where a generation loop starts feeding: the first token, and the prompt index to continue from.
 *
 * <h2>The duplicate this exists to remove</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every generation loop used to begin {@code currentToken = state.latestToken} and then ingest
 * the prompt from index 0. For families whose state is seeded with the beginning-of-text token
 * <b>and</b> whose prompt already opens with it — Llama, Mistral, Devstral, Gemma4 — that fed the
 * model <b>BOS twice</b> before a single real token. Every answer this project has produced on
 * those families was conditioned on the doubled token.
 *
 * <p>It could not be fixed by dropping the seed. Qwen2, Qwen3, DeepSeek and Phi3 override {@code
 * shouldAddBeginOfText()} and seed {@code latestToken} with a <i>start-header</i> token their
 * prompts do not repeat, so for them the seed is a real first token and removing it would corrupt
 * the prompt. The duplication is specific, so the fix is specific: skip the seed only when it is
 * literally the token the prompt already starts with, and only at the start of a conversation.
 *
 * <h2>Why the start position matters</h2>
 *
 * <p>In a continued conversation {@code state.latestToken} is the last token generated, and the
 * prompt is the new turn — which does not repeat it. Feeding the seed there is correct, and a
 * coincidental equality between the last generated token and the new turn's first token must not be
 * mistaken for the duplication above. So the check is gated on {@code startPosition == 0}: at
 * position zero the prompt is the entire context, and nothing precedes it.
