 * What a batched-decode run is configured with.
 *
 * <p>Eleven knobs that were eleven {@code -Dbatch.decode.*} system properties read from the middle
 * of a 400-line method. As properties they had three problems: two runs in one JVM could not
 * differ, a caller could not see what a run was configured with, and the coupling to {@code
 * llama.prefillBatchSize} was enforced by an exception thrown after the model had loaded.
 *
 * @param batchSize slots decoded together, {@code B}
 * @param decodeContext context length each slot is given
 * @param decodeTokens tokens decoded per slot
 * @param cudaGraphs whether the plan is captured as a CUDA graph
 * @param paged whether key/value storage is block-addressed
 * @param blockSize tokens per block, when paged
 * @param blocks blocks in the pool, when paged
 * @param continuous whether finished slots are refilled while others run
 * @param requests total requests to serve in continuous mode
 * @param minDecodeTokens the shortest a refilled request may be
 * @param prefixCache whether a shared prompt prefix is cached across requests, paged only
 * @param temperature sampling temperature; {@code 0} is greedy
 * @param deviceSample whether the argmax runs on the device, greedy only
