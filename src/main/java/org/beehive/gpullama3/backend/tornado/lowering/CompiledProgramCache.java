/**
 * The model handle's internal compiled-program cache.
 *
 * <p>Internal in v1: no type, key or statistic of it appears in a public signature. Populated
 * lazily, released with the model, and never a single mutable slot.
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency and failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Concurrent identical misses <b>compile once</b> — the first caller holds the entry's monitor
 * and the others wait on it — and a <b>failed compilation removes the pending entry</b> and
 * propagates to every waiter, so no failure is cached and a later request retries.
 *
 * <p>{@code invoke(.)} on a resulting entry remains <b>not thread-safe</b>; that is the caller's
 * serialization to arrange, not this class's.
 *
 * <h2>What a hit actually means</h2>
 *
 * <p>A hit means "the same compiled program, bound to the same physical arrays". The {@link
 * BindingDomain} in the key is what carries the second half, and it compares by identity rather
 * than by shape — two domains with identical dimensions are still two domains. Getting that wrong
 * would hand one session a program bound to another session's buffers, which under CUDA graph
 * capture produces wrong output rather than an error.
