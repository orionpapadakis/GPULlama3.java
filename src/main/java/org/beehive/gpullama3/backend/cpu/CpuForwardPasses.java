/**
 * Resolves the host forward pass for an architecture, once.
 *
 * <p>Discovery happens at class initialization — at most once per application class loader — so it
 * is not on any execution path, let alone the per-token one. A resolved {@link ForwardPass} is held
 * by the caller for the life of the model.
 *
 * <h2>Absence is an error, not a fallback</h2>
 *
 * <p>An architecture with no provider is a configuration problem, and the likeliest cause is a
 * shaded jar that lost the service file. Falling back to some default routine would run the wrong
 * arithmetic for the family and produce plausible tokens, which is the worst way for this to fail.
 * Duplicates fail too, naming both: there is no priority order to break the tie with, deliberately.
