 *   <li>{@link #logicalBytes()} — the buffers themselves, shared storage counted once. What a model

 *   <li>{@link #predictedBudgetBytes()} — what the backend's memory budget is predicted to be

 * <p>The first two differ by more than rounding. Measured on {@code Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-F16},
 * batched prefill's logical bytes are ~2.4 GiB and its budget consumption ~4.2 GiB, because the
 * per-layer weights are bound into two graph families and allocated twice. A preflight that
 * reported only logical bytes would admit that load against a 3 GiB budget and it would still die
 * part-allocated.
