/**
 * What a device-resident buffer is <b>for</b> — the classification a memory plan reasons over.
 *
 * <p>Neutral by construction: these are logical roles, not TornadoVM concepts. A backend decides
 * how many physical allocations a role costs; this layer only says what exists and who owns it.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the per-layer / global split exists.</b> It is the difference that decides batched
 * prefill's footprint. Batched prefill builds a second family of layer graphs, so the buffers a
 * *layer* graph binds are allocated twice while the buffers bound by the single activation and
 * logits graphs are allocated once. Measured on Llama-3.2-1B-F16, batched prefill costs 1872 MiB
 * more than single-token, and the per-layer weights are 1856 MiB — the *whole* weight set is 2357
 * MiB, which would not have matched. Collapsing the two into one "weights" class would have made
 * that prediction wrong by 500 MiB.
