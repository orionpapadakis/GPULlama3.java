 * <p>An enumeration rather than free-form strings: the producers are backends and the consumers are
 * the engine and the API, and a typo in a string key between the two is a metric that is silently
 * never read. Every key is named for the thing measured, not for where it is measured — {@link
 * #DEVICE_KERNEL_TIME} is device kernel time whichever backend reports it.
 *
 * <p>Keys are added as the milestone that produces them lands. A key nothing writes yet is worse
 * than no key: it reads as a supported measurement that is always zero.
