 * One step's worth of work, as positions in fixed-width arrays.

 * present and marked inactive, because the kernels execute the whole batch every step and a slot
 * that vanished from the arrays would silently shift every slot after it.
 *
 * @param active per slot: does it hold a live sequence
 * @param tokens per slot: the token to feed it this step. Ignored where inactive
 * @param positions per slot: the sequence position this token occupies. Ignored where inactive
 * @param kvSlots per slot: its row in the KV block table. Ignored where inactive
