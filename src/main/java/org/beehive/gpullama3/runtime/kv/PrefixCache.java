/**
 * Blocks of KV that several sequences can read, because they begin with the same tokens.
 *
 * <p>A system prompt, a few-shot preamble, a tool schema — served traffic repeats its openings, and
 * every repetition is prefill the device has already done. This remembers the blocks holding it so
 * the next sequence starting with the same tokens can point at them instead.
 *
 * <h2>What identity means here</h2>
 *
 * <p>A cached entry is keyed by the <b>exact token sequence of a whole number of blocks</b>. Not by
 * a hash of the text, not by a prefix of arbitrary length: a block is the unit the block table can
 * point at, so a partial block is not shareable, and the tokens must match exactly because the KV
 * is a function of them.
 *
 * <p>A cached block is referenced by the cache itself, so it survives the lease that created it —
 * that is the whole point. It is released when the entry is evicted <b>and</b> no live lease still
 * names it, which the pool's reference counts decide. A block a lease holds is pinned and cannot be
 * evicted: re-pointing it would break replay of any captured graph reading it, and would do so as
 * wrong output rather than an error [C1].
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe on its own; {@link KvCacheManager} is the synchronizing owner.
