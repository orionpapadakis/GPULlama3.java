/**
 * A session's claim on KV storage: the blocks it may write, and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>A session <b>holds</b> a lease; it does not own storage [Rule 7]. That is what lets blocks
 * outlive a session and be shared between sequences once prefix caching exists, and what keeps the
 * cache off the model.
 *
 * <p>Blocks named by a live lease are <b>pinned</b>: the pool will not hand them to anyone else
 * until the lease is closed. Closing is idempotent, and a closed lease answers nothing — using one
 * is a bug that should surface here rather than as a wrong answer later.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe: a lease belongs to one session, and a session is one sequence.
