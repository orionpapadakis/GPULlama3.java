/**
 * The persistent block store behind the KV cache, and the one block table the kernels walk.

 * <p><b>One array, allocated once</b> [C1]. Host code updates the table's <i>contents</i>; it never
 * replaces the array. CUDA-graph capture records buffer addresses, so a captured graph replays
 * against the addresses it captured — reallocating the table on a lease would silently invalidate
 * every captured graph. That is why {@link #blockTable()} hands out the same array for the pool's
 * whole life and why growing capacity is not something a lease can trigger.
 *
 * <p><b>The table is slot-major</b>, which is what lets a KV index say <i>which lease</i>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * blockTable[slot * blocksPerSlot + logicalBlock] = physical block, or UNMAPPED
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Physical blocks and logical slots are separate scarce resources.</b> A slot is an address
 * range in the table; a block is storage. Two leases never share a slot, and never share a block
 * either until prefix sharing arrives — at which point the same physical block will legitimately
 * appear under two slots, which this layout already expresses.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe on its own; {@link KvCacheManager} is the synchronizing owner.
