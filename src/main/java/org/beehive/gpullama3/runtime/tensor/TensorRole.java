/**
 * What a tensor is for.
 *
 * <p>A <b>closed set owned by the runtime layer</b>, deliberately not a free-form string: a string
 * role becomes a second dispatch key that architecture-specific code can branch on, which is the
 * thing [Rule 15](./././././././docs/architecture/architecture.md) exists to prevent. Adding an
 * architecture must not mean adding a role — it means reusing these.
 *
 * <p>Seeded from the weight fields the loaders already read. Whether {@code Weights} itself becomes
 * a map keyed by role is a separate, still-open question (open question 6).
