/**
 * The stable, opaque identity of a resolved device — what equality and the compiled-program cache
 * key compare.
 *
 * <p><b>Opaque on purpose.</b> The handle is whatever the backend uses to name one device to
 * itself, and nothing above the backend may parse it. What matters is only that it is <b>stable for
 * the life of the process</b> and <b>equal exactly when the device is the same one</b>: a cache key
 * component that changes underneath the cache silently produces one compiled program per lookup,
 * which is the defect {@code LoweredPlanSelection}'s device label already had once when it read
 * {@code System.getProperty("tornado.device")} — that property reads {@code "default"} before
 * TornadoVM initializes and {@code "0"} afterwards.
 *
 * <p><b>What is deliberately not here.</b> Capabilities. They are <b>not</b> a function of the
 * device identifier — the scheduler mode is overridable, so two lowerings on one device can differ
 * — so they live in {@link DeviceCapabilities} and enter the cache key separately. Putting them
 * here would make two different lowerings collide because their device happened to match.
