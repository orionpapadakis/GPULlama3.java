/**
 * What a pool has and what is left of it.
 *
 * <p>They describe <b>the pool this runtime sized and what it has handed out</b> — not what the
 * device has free. A physical free-memory query was considered for this task and rejected:
 * TornadoVM recycles buffers, works within a configured device-memory budget, and releases at the
 * process level with a delay, so "bytes free" is not a number admission can be correct about. It
 * would also change admission behaviour, which is precisely what this task's acceptance forbids.
 * Physical-memory-aware admission is future work with its own measurements and its own contract —
 * <b>not</b> a widening of this record.
 *
 * @param totalBlocks blocks the pool was sized for
 * @param freeBlocks blocks not currently leased
 * @param blockSizeTokens tokens one block holds
 * @param bytesPerBlock device bytes one block occupies, across all layers
