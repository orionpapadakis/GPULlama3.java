/**
 * What a device can do that lowering may vary on — an immutable set, and a cache-key component.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is separate from {@link DeviceId}</h2>
 *
 * <p>It would be safe to leave out of the compiled-program cache key <b>only</b> if capabilities
 * were a deterministic, immutable function of the device identifier. They are not: the scheduler
 * mode is overridable, so two lowerings of one program on one device can differ. Two different
 * lowerings must never collide because their device identifier happened to match.
 *
 * <p>The general rule, which is also the bar for adding a {@link DeviceCapability}: <b>if changing
 * an input can change task count, task names, kernels, grid entries or bindings, it must
 * distinguish cache entries.</b>
