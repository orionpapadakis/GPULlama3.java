/**
 * Which execution implementation — the CPU, or one of TornadoVM's accelerator backends.
 *
 * <p><b>A value, not an enum</b>. An enum would have to be edited in this package every time a
 * backend is added, which is the shape Rule 15 exists to prevent: adding a backend should mean
 * adding an implementation, not editing a list in the layer above it. The constants below are
 * conveniences for the ones that exist today; {@link #of(String)} accepts any other.
 *
 * <p>The identifier is canonicalized to lower case so that {@code "CUDA"} and {@code "cuda"} are
 * the same backend. It is compared by value and is stable across runs, which is what lets it sit in
 * {@code ProgramCacheKey} — see {@link DeviceId} for the device half of that key.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a selector.</b> A {@code BackendId} says which implementation; a {@link DeviceSelector}
 * says what is being asked for, including this. The two are separate because a selector may leave
 * the backend unspecified, and because a request must never be used as a cache key.
