/**
 * What an architecture needs to describe a program, and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>A description is a function of these four: the model's shape, how its weights were
 * materialized, how key/value entries are stored, and the execution choices that select components
 * (device sampling adds one, split-KV changes the policy descriptor). All four end up in the {@code
 * ProgramSignature}, which is why they are inputs rather than something the architecture looks up.
 *
 * @param configuration the model's shape; the architecture validates it
 * @param weights the materialized weight representation
 * @param keyValue how key/value entries are stored
 * @param policy the execution policy the program is described under
