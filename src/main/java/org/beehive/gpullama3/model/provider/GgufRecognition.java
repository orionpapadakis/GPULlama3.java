/**
 * Which architecture a GGUF file declares itself to be.
 *
 * <p>Replaces the substring match over {@code general.name} that recognition used to be. The file
 * states its architecture in {@code general.architecture}; reading that is both more reliable and
 * cheaper to reason about than matching words in a display name that anyone may set.
 *
 * <h2>Why the name is still consulted</h2>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code general.architecture} does not always discriminate, and the corpus says so:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.Q8_0.gguf              arch=llama     name=models--mistralai--Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
 *   DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B.gguf              arch=qwen2     name=DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 1.5B
 *   Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512-Q4_K_M.gguf  arch=mistral3  name=Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Mistral and older Devstral builds ship as {@code llama}; the DeepSeek distill ships as {@code
 * qwen2}; Devstral's newer builds ship as {@code mistral3}. They need different tokenizers, chat
 * formats or RoPE bases, so the name is the only thing that tells them apart — but it is consulted
 * <b>within</b> a declared architecture, not across all of them. That is the difference from the
 * old chain, where "llama" anywhere in a name could win outright.
 *
 * <p>A file with no declared architecture falls back to the old name matching, so models produced
 * by tools that omit the key keep loading.
