/**
 * The shape every built-in family provider has: one identity, one loader, and recognition that asks
 * the file what it is.
 *
 * <p>Every provider asks {@link GgufRecognition} the same question and claims the source only when
 * the answer is its own identity. Two providers therefore cannot both claim a file — the ambiguity
 * check in {@link ModelProviders} guards against a future provider that decides for itself, not
 * against these.
 *
 * <p>Extending this is a convenience, not a requirement. The SPI is {@link ModelProvider}; a
 * provider that recognizes its files some other way implements that directly.
