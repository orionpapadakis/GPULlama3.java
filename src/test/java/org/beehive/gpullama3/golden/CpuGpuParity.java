/**
 * Runs the same fixture and prompt through the CPU path and the GPU path and compares the logits.
 * The CPU path is the reference, as specified in {@code verification-gates.md} §CPU↔GPU parity.
 * Cross-path comparison is never bit-exact — different orders of the same arithmetic, and on the
 * FP16 path a different storage format for the activations — so it uses tolerances, and NaN/Inf on
 * either side fails.
 *
 * <p><b>Four complementary gates</b>, because one worst-element assertion cannot distinguish a
 * broken kernel from one unlucky tail value out of 8.2 million:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Elementwise</b> {@code |gpu − cpu| ≤ atol + rtol·|cpu|}, the conventional mixed bound
 *       (the same shape as {@code torch.testing.assert_close}), with a small violation budget;
 *   <li><b>Hard ceiling</b> on the single largest absolute error, so the budget can never hide a
 *       large excursion;
 *   <li><b>Whole-vector</b> relative L2 and cosine similarity, which describe the row as a whole
 *       instead of being decided by its most extreme element;
 *   <li><b>Decision-level</b>: argmax agreement and top-k overlap. An argmax reversal is only a
 *       failure when the CPU considered the decision clear-cut — a reversed near-tie is expected
 *       between numerical paths and is reported, not tolerated silently.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Thresholds are measured, not assumed</b>, and are per quantization: the FP16 GPU path
 * stores its normalized activations as FP16 while the CPU path keeps FP32, so its floor is set by
 * that format, whereas the Q8_0 path keeps FP32 activations and tracks the CPU far more closely.
 * They come from {@code golden/ParityProfile} on the pinned tuple and sit roughly 2× above the
 * observed worst case. Re-derive them with that tool if the tuple, the prompt or the compared-token
 * count changes; do not widen them to make a failing run pass.
 *
 * <p><b>The two absolute-scale bounds are fractions of the reference's own RMS.</b> A constant
 * {@code atol} does not transfer between families: Granite-3.2-2B's logits have an RMS of 233
 * against Llama-3.2-1B's 2.92, because Granite multiplies its logits by its {@code logit_scale}. A
 * constant calibrated on Llama leaves nearly every Llama element inside {@code atol} and tested
 * only absolutely, while putting nearly every Granite element outside it and tested only relatively
 * — so the same code reads as clean on one family and broken on the other. Normalising holds every
 * family to one standard, and it *tightens* the gate for the families whose logits are small.
 *
 * <p>The FP16 bounds were 5-20x looser until the CPU reference stopped flushing denormal FP16
 * weights to zero. Most of what this gate used to tolerate was error on the reference side, not the
 * GPU's.
 *
 * <p><b>Teacher forcing</b> is what makes the comparison meaningful: greedy decoding is
 * autoregressive, so the first near-tie that tips differently sends the two paths into different
 * contexts and every later row compares unrelated states. Forcing the GPU along the CPU's tokens
 * keeps the KV state identical at every compared position.
 *
 * <p><b>One family per subclass, and therefore per JVM.</b> Device memory a closed session frees
 * returns to TornadoVM's buffer provider but not to the driver, so a class that loads every fixture
 * exhausts the device partway through and the failures land on whichever model happened to run late
 * rather than on whichever one is wrong. Surefire forks per class, so the split is what makes each
 * result attributable.
