/**
 * Both are the kind of thing a structural rule cannot catch. A norm that ran over the whole query
 * instead of per head, or a projection width taken from {@code dim} instead of from {@code
 * attention.key_length}, would produce a valid-looking program and a different model. Only running
 * it against the legacy path shows the difference.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is <b>bit-identical logits</b> between the lowered and legacy paths, taken in
 * one process against one file — a stronger statement than a recorded golden, and it needs no
 * committed data. Every case asserts {@link LoweredPlanSelection#loweredPlanCount()} moved: a
 * family whose description or validation was wrong would fall back to the legacy plan and produce a
 * perfect match that proves nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>One family per class</b>, because the accel suite forks one JVM per class and a closed
 * session's device memory does not come back. Two families of models in one JVM exhausts the
 * device; it did, which is why this is three classes rather than one.
