/**
 * The comparison is <b>bit-identical logits</b> between the lowered and legacy paths, taken in one
 * process against one file — a stronger statement than a recorded golden, and it needs no committed
 * data. Every case asserts {@link LoweredPlanSelection#loweredPlanCount()} moved: a family whose
 * description or validation was wrong would fall back to the legacy plan and produce a perfect
 * match that proves nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>One family per class</b>, because the accel suite forks one JVM per class and a closed
 * session's device memory does not come back. Two families of models in one JVM exhausts the
 * device; it did, which is why this is three classes rather than one.
