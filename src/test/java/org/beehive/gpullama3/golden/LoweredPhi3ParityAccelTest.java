/**
 * The widths are what a device check earns here. A split that read a different width than its
 * projection produced would address past the end of the buffer, and the halves would still look
 * like halves — the tokens are the only thing that shows it.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is <b>bit-identical logits</b> between the lowered and legacy paths, taken in
 * one process against one file — a stronger statement than a recorded golden, and it needs no
 * committed data. Every case asserts {@link LoweredPlanSelection#loweredPlanCount()} moved: a
 * family whose description or validation was wrong would fall back to the legacy plan and produce a
 * perfect match that proves nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>One family per class</b>, because the accel suite forks one JVM per class and a closed
 * session's device memory does not come back. Two families of models in one JVM exhausts the
 * device; it did, which is why this is three classes rather than one.
