     * batch-prefill kernels only on CUDA. That reading does not apply to <em>this</em> path: the
     * plan components pick the MMA layer class only when the device advertises {@code

     * Metal device takes the non-MMA class and never reaches an MMA kernel. What actually failed
     * here was TornadoVM 5.2.0's interpreter — {@code consumeFromDevice} resolving against the
     * previously executed graph rather than the named one, surfacing as {@code
     * NullPointerException: XPUDeviceBufferState.getXPUBuffer() is null}. Fixed upstream in PR #996
     * and released in 6.0.0, which this project now pins; with that pin this test passes on Metal,
     * teacher-forced parity assertion included.
     *
     * <p>The MMA gap is real, but it belongs to the multi-sequence <em>engine</em> path, where
     * {@code BatchedEngineAccelTest} still gates on the capability and still bails on {@code
     * gemmMMAQKV} — "MMA instructions only supported for the CUDA backend". Keep that gate; this
     * one was measuring a different thing.
