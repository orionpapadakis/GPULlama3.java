/**
 * An earlier run of this slice's gate looked green while the opt-in had <b>never reached the
 * JVM</b>: a {@code -DargLine} override had replaced the accel profile's own arguments, so the
 * property was absent and every session quietly took the legacy path. Eighteen tests passed and
 * proved nothing about the lowering.
 *
 * <p>So this test does not read the property back, and does not trust a log. It reads {@link
 * LoweredPlanSelection#loweredPlanCount()} before and after, and <b>fails if the count did not
 * move</b>. A fallback to legacy construction is therefore a failure, not a silent pass.
 *
 * <p>It was outside it for a measured reason: every GPU session built its own plan holding its own
 * device copy of the weights, so adding one more model load to the shared JVM made an unrelated
 * test — {@code FacadeParityAccelTest} — fail with {@code TornadoOutOfMemory}. Sharing removed the
 * duplication, and the suite forks one JVM per class, which is what actually returns device memory:
 * a closed session's buffers go back to TornadoVM's buffer provider, not to the driver, and the
 * provider recycles them only under budget pressure.
 *
 * <h2>What this slice does and does not claim</h2>
