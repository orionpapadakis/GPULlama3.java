/**
 * It asserts <b>codes and structure</b>, never whole sentences. Pinning prose would fail on every
 * wording improvement and teach people to stop improving them; the code and the facts are the
 * contract, and the sentence around them is free to get better.
 *
 * <p>The check runs against the <b>source tree</b> rather than by invoking each failure. Several
 * categories need a GPU, a malformed model file or a duplicate provider on the classpath, and a
 * catalogue that could only be verified with all of those present would be verified by nobody. What
 * matters here is the invariant a catalogue can actually lose: a code that names a failure nothing
 * throws, or a documented failure with no code.
