/**
 * A generation call allocates two different things: a <b>fixed</b> amount per call — tokenizing the
 * prompt, the chat template, the result — and a <b>per-token</b> amount inside the decode loop.
 * Only the second is this milestone's subject, and a single measurement cannot tell them apart: at
 * 32 tokens the fixed cost is a quarter of the total and would drown the difference being looked
 * for.
 *
 * <p>So the measurement is taken at <b>two token counts</b> and the per-token cost read off as the
 * slope, {@code (bytes(n2) - bytes(n1)) / (n2 - n1)}, which cancels the intercept exactly. Measured
 * on this machine: about **8 MiB fixed per call** and **650 KiB per token**, and the claim under
 * test is that the lowered path's slope matches the legacy path's.
 *
 * <p><b>Warm-up matters, and getting it wrong produced a false result once.</b> The first
 * measurement taken in a JVM reads ~9% lower than every later one, whichever path it is —
 * interpreting that as "the lowered path allocates 10% more" is exactly the mistake this comment
 * exists to prevent. Both paths are therefore exercised once before anything is recorded.
 *
 * <p>The 650 KiB itself is <b>not</b> the invocation boundary's: it is the same on the legacy path,
 * which has no boundary at all, and it survives a decode loop whose Java code allocates nothing
 * vocabulary-sized. It is TornadoVM's per-execution bookkeeping. The boundary adds one {@code
 * Result} record per token and no array.
 *
 * <h2>It was seen to fail, and what it cannot see</h2>
 *
 * <p>A vocabulary-sized {@code float[]} added to {@code SharedWorkspacePlan.invoke} moves the
 * lowered slope from 627 KiB to 1140 KiB — exactly the 513 KiB the array costs — and this test
 * fails. That control was run, and reverted.
 *
 * <p>The <b>first</b> attempt at that control did not fail, and the reason is a real limit of the
 * method: an allocation that does not escape is scalarized by the JIT and never happens. So this
 * test proves that no allocation <i>survives optimization</i> per token, which is what matters for
 * a decode loop — not that no {@code new} appears in the source.
