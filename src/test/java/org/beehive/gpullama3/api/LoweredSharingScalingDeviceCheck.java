/**
 * Split out of {@link LoweredSharedWorkspaceAccelTest}, which asserts sharing. These are
 * <b>measurements</b>: eight legacy sessions hold eight device copies of the weights — 17 GiB on
 * the machine this was recorded on — and the point of the sweep is exactly that cost. They are
 * therefore <b>deliberately outside the automatic accel suite</b>, and not because they are flaky
 * or slow: a test whose purpose is to consume the device cannot share one with anything else.
 *
 * <p>This is a different reason from the one that kept the lowered correctness checks out until
 * sharing landed. Those rejoined the suite; these will not, and should not.
 *
 * <p><b>One measurement per JVM.</b> Running the class whole fails, and the reason is the subject
 * itself: a closed session's device memory goes back to TornadoVM's buffer provider but not to the
 * driver, and the provider recycles it only under budget pressure — so the second measurement in a
 * JVM starts with the first one's sessions still resident. Each method passes on its own:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   source ~/TornadoVM/setvars.sh &amp;&amp; mvn verify -Paccel-tests \
 *       -Dtest=LoweredSharingScalingDeviceCheck#scaling_lowered_8 -DfailIfNoTests=false
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Verified 2026-09-01: all five green run one at a time, three of five red run together. That is
 * a property of the measurement, not a defect in it.
 *
 * <p>Recorded 2026-08-31, peak device memory less a 79 MiB idle baseline: legacy 3131 / 8339 /
 * 17335 MiB at 2 / 4 / 8 sessions; lowered flat at 3243 MiB. The crossover is between two and four
 * sessions — at two, the pool sized for eight makes sharing 112 MiB <i>worse</i>.
