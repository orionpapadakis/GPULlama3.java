# GPULlama3.java — engine documentation

A Java-native transformer inference engine that compiles reusable Java inference
components through TornadoVM into execution plans for local accelerators. TornadoVM is the
compiler and runtime; this project never builds its own IR or generates device code.

## Where to look

## Supported platforms

| | |
| --- | --- |
| JDKs | 21 and 25. Each publishes its own artifact — `gpu-llama3:<version>-jdk21` and `-jdk25` — against its own TornadoVM line. Any other JDK fails the build with a message naming both |
| Backends | CPU (plain Java, Vector API), and through TornadoVM: CUDA, OpenCL and Metal |
| Platforms | Linux on NVIDIA (CUDA and OpenCL), macOS on Apple silicon (Metal) |
| Model formats | GGUF, in F32, F16, BF16, Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_K, Q5_K and Q6_K |
| Families | Llama, Mistral, Qwen2, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, Granite, Phi-3, Gemma-4, Devstral |

## The system in one paragraph

A GGUF file is recognized by a registered provider, which loads it into an immutable
**model**: configuration, weights, tokenizer and chat format. A **session** opened from
that model owns one sequence — its position, its KV lease, its sampler, its conversation.
Generating turns the family's architecture description into a backend-neutral **inference
program**, which a **backend** compiles once into a **compiled program** with a fixed
device workspace, and then invokes many times. Invocations move values into persistent
control arrays; they never rebind buffers. KV storage lives in a pooled block store that
sessions lease from, so several sessions can share one compiled program and one device copy
of the weights. Above sessions, an optional **engine** tier batches requests across
sequences. The public façade exposes none of this: no TornadoVM type, no GGUF type and no
CLI type appears in any public signature.

## Constraints that are not negotiable

These are enforced by tests, not by convention, and each one exists because breaking it
produced a real failure:

- **Compile once, execute many.** A compiled program is never rebuilt per token, and an
  invocation allocates nothing.
- **Fixed binding identity.** Every device array bound into a captured graph keeps its
  identity for the program's life. Captured-graph replay bakes addresses, and re-pointing a
  buffer produces wrong output rather than an error.
- **Backends own lowering and fusion.** Nothing above the backend SPI expresses kernel
  choice, and nothing above it can observe one except through metrics.
- **Materialization is a backend concern.** Where a quantized weight is decoded is decided
  by the backend that executes it, not by the model or the kernel.
- **No silent fallback.** An unsupported device, lowering or storage request is refused,
  never quietly substituted.
- **Dependencies point downward.** TornadoVM types stay inside the Tornado backend, and
  nothing below the engine depends on the engine.
- **Numerical claims are scored against the CPU.** A GPU-versus-GPU comparison cannot see a
  defect that moves the whole GPU, and a process that exits 0 at a normal throughput has
  proved nothing.
- **Bounds are never widened and goldens are never regenerated to make a failure pass.**
